  <h3>Are bitcoins money?</h3>
  <p>Bitcoins have no intrinsic value in the way that gold has intrinsic value. This means that bitcoins could lose all of their value overnight. Mises outlines in his <b>Theory of Money and Credit</b> that money is essentially the most useful and liquid commodity. That commodity which can be traded for any necessary goods and services. Traditionally, this has been gold (and even cattle at certain times). Bitcoins could, therefore, be considered money if they become useful in obtaining goods and services. There are already goods and services that can be purchased with bitcoins including the popular online content provider WordPress. Bitcoins are also useful in moving money around the world as they can be instantly transferred anywhere. The distributed bitcoin protocol creates a scarcity of the currency and the massive P2P Bitcoin network creates value by verifying transactions to prevent fraud. Hundreds of thousands of people use bitcoin and this makes it money. It is exchangeable for goods and services and has liquidity. Moreover, bitcoins share many similarities to gold which can be found throughout this document.</p>

  <h3>Decentralization</h3>
  <p>Bitcoin is the first decentralized currency ever created. Where fiat currencies like the Federal Reserve Note or the Euro are printed by central banks and transactions are authorized through a banking network which requires trust between member banks, the Bitcoin network is completely decentralized and relies on the users of Bitcoin to provide security and fraud prevention to the network.</p>
  
  <p>The main problem that is encountered with decentralized money is summed up in the double spending problem. Double spending occurs when an entity attempts to spend the same bitcoins twice. This is the problem which Bitcoin solves that makes it so innovative. The system can only be defeated if the number of malicious nodes exceeds the number of benevolent nodes. There have been times when double spending caused a concern but the development community quickly fixed the problems and Bitcoin survived.</p>
  
  <h3>Issuance&#0151;Mining bitcoins</h3>
  <p>In order to insure that distribution is fair, bitcoins are introduced into the network through a process called mining. This is a fairly technical process in which participants in the network attempt to solve a complicated cryptography problem which simultaneously does a proof of work on the <i>blockchain</i> to verify the authenticity of transactions. The blockchain is essentially a public ledger of every transaction that has occurred (although eventually transaction history is truncated to avoid excessive block size). All participants are looking for numbers that have certain mathematical properties and the first one to find the number solves the block. As a reward the person is allowed to enter a one time transaction of 25 BTC to himself. The solved block verifies transactions and prevents forgery. The reward used to be 50 BTC but it halved and will continue to halve. Currently there are around 10 million bitcoins but there will eventually be 21 million and then no more will be introduced. This ensures that inflation will not be a problem and that currency will actually appreciate in value, i.e., sound money.</p>

  <h3>Anonymity</h3>
  <p>Bitcoin transactions are completely anonymous, geographic location is traceable and hash addresses can be used to link transactions, but one can create as many hash addresses as desired so this can be avoided. Since security is paramount, especially with a currency that's value lies in its security, it seems prudent to create new hash addresses for separate transactions if one wishes to remain anonymous. If proper precautions are taken and the user has the necessary understanding of Bitcoin, anonymity can be maintained better than any existing method. Bitcoins are transferred through the Internet and verified for authenticity by anonymous users on the network.</p>
