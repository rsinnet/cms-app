    As I found myself pondering the question of human perception in the context of competence, I embarked, as one might under such circumstances, on a literature search on the Internet.

    Using the standard tools &#0150; <a href="http://wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a> &#0150; I was able to glean a cursory understanding of the field including some of the keystone works.

    Naturally, the next step was to scrutinze the more fundamental pieces but alas my journey was to take an unfortunate .
    
    As I attempted to locate numerous articles, I found that access was to be obtained only at great monetary cost to me, the reader, and that not even my large university could provide me with online access.

    This recurring nightmare, this seemingly innocuous impediment for the inquisitive imagination maintains a veil of ignorance upon humanity &#0150; a veil that has been omnipresent even if we may often like to fantasize delusionally about instances of historical utopia.

    The year is 2013 and it is still somehow prohibitively difficult to peruse scholarly work on many important topics.

    Shouldn't most information be universally accessible by now?

    It is understandable and lawful even if unscrupulous that companies maintain trade secrets due the competitive advantages which some such secrets can afford yet the scope is generally limited and the focus esoteric.

    But what is more disconcerting by far is the current system of distribution for general scientific literature.
  </p>

  <p>
    When a scientist publishes his work in a journal or even in the proceedings of a conference, it is often made available online (and sometimes only online) but at a hefty cost to both the writer and the reader.

    A fairly new paradigm effected by the Internet modifies the standard model by shifting the cost entirely away from the reader and fully onto the writer.

    However, the cost is often substantial and many researches like me have avoided this model in favor of the standard model where our publication costs are lower.

    An unfortunate side effect being that the readership is then restricted as only subscribers or purchasers are permitted to peruse publications whereas the open access model grants general access over the Internet.
