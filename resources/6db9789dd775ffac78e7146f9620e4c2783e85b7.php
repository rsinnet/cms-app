    As I found myself pondering the question of human perception in the context of competence, I embarked, as one might under such circumstances, on a literature search on the Internet.

    Using the standard tools &#0150; <a href="http://wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a> &#0150; I was able to glean a cursory understanding of the field including some of the keystone works.

    Naturally, the next step was to scrutinize the more fundamental pieces but alas my journey was to take an unfortunate turn.
    
    As I attempted to locate numerous articles, I found that access was to be obtained only at great monetary cost to me, the reader, and that not even my large university could provide me with online access.

    This recurring nightmare, this ostensibly innocuous impediment for the inquisitive imagination maintains a veil of ignorance upon humanity &#0150; a veil that has been omnipresent even if we may often like to fantasize about instances of historical utopia.
  </p>
  <p>
    The year is 2013 and it is still somehow prohibitively difficult to peruse scholarly work on many important topics.

    Shouldn't most information be universally accessible by now?

    It is understandable and lawful even if unscrupulous that companies maintain trade secrets due the competitive advantages which some such secrets can afford yet the scope is generally limited and the focus esoteric.

    But what is more disconcerting by far is the current system of distribution for general scientific literature.

    When a scientist publishes his work in a journal or even in the proceedings of a conference, it is often made available online (and sometimes only online) but at a hefty cost to both the writer and the reader.

    A fairly new paradigm effected by the Internet modifies the standard model by shifting the cost entirely away from the reader and fully onto the writer.

    However, the cost is often substantial and these newer journals are less established and thus many researches like me have avoided this model in favor of the standard model where our publication costs are lower.

    An unfortunate side effect being that readership is then restricted as only subscribers or purchasers are permitted to peruse publications whereas the open access model grants general access over the Internet.

    This particularly heinous facet is emblematic of the failures of mankind's contemporary knowledge distribution infrastructure as a whole.
  </p>

  <p>
    The wealth of human knowledge is now so expansive that a curious being might pose and answer many questions which arouse his interests by simply reading through the literature on the relevant topics.

    And yet general access is still wanting and the thoughtful among us still hunger for knowledge even as we hunger for food in a global society suffering not only from rampant inflation and but also from a lack of knowledge.

    O' that the wisdom of ages were not a secret so closely guarded, tucked away for safekeeping to the detriment of all free men, for the quest for knowledge must surely unite all men and women in the bonds of brotherhood.

    If the people but knew of the ploys of their leaders, they would readily retire the intransigent bellicosity that historically seems so characteric of the human experience and we might finally enjoy peace.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let us hope that this peace comes sooner rather than later as the world is and has for decades been on the brink of nuclear war.

    But this can only be if the people are brave and stand up for what is right.

    As Tolstoy muses in his <span style="font-style:italic;">War and Peace</span>, <q>&#8220;If everyone fought for their own convictions there would be no war.&#8221;</q>

    Tolstoy is indeed referring to the charade that is war and, along the same lines, John Steinbeck later writes in his <span style="font-style:italic;">Once There Was A War</span>, &#8220;All war is a symptom of man's failure as a thinking animal.&#8221;

    In modern times, Julian Assange stated in an <a href="http://rt.com/news/wikileaks-revelations-assange-interview/" target="_blank">interview</a> with BBC News: <q>&#8220;Basically, populations don't like wars, and populations have to be fooled into wars; populations don't willingly, with open eyes, go into a war.&#8221;</q>

    This conclusion which echoes through the &#230;ons seems timeless and universal: that mankind can live in a peaceful world.

  </p>

  <p>
    But what are these enigmatic secrets to which I have so cryptically referred that can free a man's mind from the banalities of everyday life?

    Perhaps it is not so much individual secrets but the grander panorama which is increasingly revealed by each additional piece of knowledge that helps a person transcend the mundane and perceive a more accurate reality, one in which the veil no longer obscures the present collapse of the rule of law.

    Perhaps the typical human is not well trained in logic &#0150; I dare say we can safely accept this as fact &#0150; and his mind is so fazed by emotion and self-assuredness that he cannot reject misinformation and that there is so much misinformation that it sullies his inner canvas which he uses to paint a picture of the world as he perceives it.

    Perhaps, if this be true, we the logical are failing to act, failing to share our understanding with the misguided and the myopic while the wicked employ philosophers to craft fanciful frameworks to justify the absurdity of it all &#0150; this type of arrangement is called a think tank and while a think tank can be used for good, it is more often employed by the unseemly to achieve their nefarious ends.
